Hi, I'm Trap. The name means nothing, just what I'm known as online.
I'm genuinely interested in making change and contribute as much as I can. Being of use brings me fulfillment.
I'm fairly new to the programming world and definitely welcome any useful tips or advice.
Feel free to send me a text if you want to share something useful.
